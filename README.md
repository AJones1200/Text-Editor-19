## Description: 
This homework was worked on collectively with the class. Per our instructors this is allowed. 
This is a text editor in which users can create code or snippets on a one page app, which they can retrieve later. This app includes several data persistence techniques which allow the user to view and edit offline, as well as use in any browser, even when not supported.  

## User Story:
GIVEN a text editor web application
WHEN I open my application 
THEN I will see the client server folder
WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
THEN the application starts from the backend
WHEN I run my webpack plugins
THEN I can generate a HTML file, service worker, as well as a manifest file
WHEN I use JavaScript while not connected to the internet
THEN the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
WHEN I open the text editor
THEN IndexedDB will create a database storage
WHEN I enter content and click off the DOM window
THEN content in the text editor gets saved with IndexedDB
WHEN I click on the Install button
THEN I can download my web application as an icon on my desktop
WHEN I load my web application
THEN the workbox will register a service user
WHEN I register a service worker
THEN my static assets pre cached upon loading the page and I will have proper build scripts for a webpack app
